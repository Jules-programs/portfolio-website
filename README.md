Using Next.js + React to create this Web Portfolio as I believe it will be the best for this project

I've also been trying to more fimilarize myself with this framework

#### Website/Portfolio Ideas to implement and test.

	I must prepare myself to implement these features into the website

##### Portfolio List

1. Type Racer Mobile Application Open-sourced w/ GitHub Link.
2. RuneScape styled Gif using three.js. Closed-sourced
3. I think it would be cool to generate my own procedural generation three.js method for creating different maps based on input. I can later use this for my game as a sort of engine. Closed source [[Procedurally Generated Three.js Maps]]
4. Schedulify will be closed sourced and added much later once I get closer to launching it as a full product. 
5. Open Sourced web application from database class

#### Overall Website structure

*Note: This is the general Idea that I have and does not need to be perfect or make any sense; however it is important to know I want this to be impressive and display skills I want to learn*

**Important: I need links to email, GitHub, LinkedIn etc...**

At the top a welcome message, a professional layout to draw a slick with a small footer message that displays "Jump to Portfolio" as you scroll it goes downwards into; includes the three.js constellation cursor hover interaction with my Introductory paragraph in the middle. Once the message ends it has a parallax into clouds to display more web development and UI skill showing professionalism, talent, and genuine interest in creating beautiful looking websites. I have no idea what the next area is going to look like but I want there to be a Portfolio section. I will explain this now; Each item on my portfolio will have it's own class that can essentially display clearly the different skills being executed while I was creating the project. An example of what this could look like for my Type Racer Mobile Application Project


# Type Racer Mobile App

During my 5th semester of computer programming and analysis I created the logical functionality of this project with two other of my classmates. etc...

[flutter] [Mobile Dev] 

I think it would be beneficial if I would have a page that goes to the documentation or more information about the project that I'm working on. I could even use some of the things I'm writing inside of the Portfolio Website folder as well as documents like; [[Portfolio Reflection 2]]

Next I need to determine what I will be using in this project and how to implement it within tools [[Portfolio Tools]]
