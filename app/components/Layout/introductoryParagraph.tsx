                The name bestowed onto myself is Julien Mongrain; 
                A young entrepreneur creating web applications I would use. 
                The mere process of creation is what excites me. 
                In my life I have a constant flow of new ideas, 
                most of them objectively bad; however some genuinely intriguing. 
                I have a few projects I’ve created attached to this website as you 
                scroll it shall go more in depth.
